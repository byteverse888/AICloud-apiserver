# CAS Client library

CAS provides a http package compatible client implementation for use with
securing http frontends in golang.

    import "gopkg.in/cas.v2"
    
## Unmaintained

As is probably obvious I've not had any time to properly put into this project in a while, and no longer work with any projects using CAS for Authentication. Under the normal Golang suggested process I'd recommend anyone else interested in maintaining the project to fork it to a new import path. As I somewhat arrogantly took the gopkg.in/cas import path, if someone is interested in taking over the project under that path please raise an issue. That said in the current world of Golang modules and versioning style I'm not sure gopkg.in is still that relevant.

Apologies for this project having become so stagnant.
